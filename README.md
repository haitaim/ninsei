# Ninsei
Ninsei is a library for developing on the Game Boy Advance with C++.
## Preface
Fundamentally, this is more of a personal project by an amateur to get a little acquainted with embedded programming in C++.
As such, the quality of the code will probably be below par, and their may be flaws in the architecture of the libarary.
Suggestions from anyone who comes across this are greatly appreciated.
## Design
Compatibility with older versions of C++ will not be a concern, so C++20 features such as modules are free to use.
However, given that modules are currently not supported by GCC or clang, the library will be written with header files.
This will probably be the case until the release of GCC 11 and a devkitARM update.
